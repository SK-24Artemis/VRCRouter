These routes are preconfigured to use with some apps!

Before using them, you'll need to make sure that the output address and ports match the ones on the
app.

For VRCFaceTracking 5.0 you will need to configure the output address and port yourself. You can do
that by launching VRCFT, looking for the cogwheel button at the bottom left and setting the receive
port and receive ip address to match the output address and output port in the router configuration.
The send port should be set to 9000.

You'll need to use a different route depending on your VRCFaceTracking version. Make sure to use the
one that matches your version (you can find your VRCFT version in the settings page of the VRCFT
app) or else the auto-start will not work! 

Only use one of these routes at a time!

For VRCFT 5.2.3.0 and above, you can configure VRCFT to auto start with SteamVR in the settings tab
of the VRCFT app. Keep in mind you have to have SteamVR running and your HMD connected to have the
option be available.
